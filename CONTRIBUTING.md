# How to contribute

Welcome to the Green Book Api. We currently do not take contributions on code, but we do want to hear about ideas for features!

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/GWuEcmt). This is where we coordinate data acquisition and feature planning!

Here are some important resources:

  * [NGBA Wiki]() tells you what we're working on.
  * [Profiles]() tells you who we are!
  * [Git Issues]() tells you what issues we're working on!
  
## Submitting Feature Ideas

Because this is really a service made for users, we're very interested in what you, the userbase, want!

To submit a feature, please open an ISSUE and tag it with ENHANCEMENT. The title of the feature should always be a short
description of the main purpose of the feature. A good feature should have an easily understood title; if you have
trouble writing one, the scope of the feature might be too large! Once you have a title, use the description to give a
detailed summary of how the feature would work. Please check for spelling and grammar when writing, it makes it
much easier for us developers to read!

## Thanks so much for being interested in growing NGBA with us!
