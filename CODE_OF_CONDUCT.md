# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors
and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a 
harassment-free experience for marginalized people, particularly those multiply marginalized.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of viewpoints and experiences  of marginalized people
* Accepting and giving constructive criticism related to CODE ONLY, not one's HUMANITY

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, attacks on the humanity of the marginalized
* Public or private harassment
* Any idea that a TERF (trans-exclusionary radical feminist) would espouse
* Tone policing of marginalized people 

Examples of behavior we have no intent on policing include:

* Reverse "isms" (e.g. "racism against white people", "sexism against men", "cisphobia", "heterophobia", and "skinny shaming")
* Actions taken by marginalized people against their oppressors (e.g. trans people responding to TERFs)
* Sharing displeasure in any vehemence about oppression or one's oppressors (e.g. Trump voters, cops, the military, white people, etc)

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected 
to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, 
wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily 
or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is 
representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include 
using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an 
appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further 
defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the 
project team at techiecheckie@gmail.com. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, 
and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. Further details of specific 
enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary 
or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
